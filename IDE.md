## Introduction

This document outlines the design of an Internal Development Platform that unifies developer tooling, CI/CD automation, Kubernetes orchestration, observability, and secrets management into a cohesive ecosystem. The goal is to accelerate feature delivery, enforce best practices, and ensure security and reliability across all software components.

## Layers & Components

| Layer                      | Component              | Role & Description                                                                                       |
|----------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Developer Control**      | **IDE**                | Local development environment where engineers write code and run unit tests.                             |
|                            | **GitHub**             | Central source control for application and infrastructure repositories.                                  |
|                            | **Terraform**          | Infrastructure-as-Code definitions stored in GitHub; drives platform provisioning.                        |
| **Integration & Delivery** | **Jenkins**            | Hosts CI/CD pipelines to build, test, and package application artifacts.                                 |
|                            | **Amazon EKS**         | Kubernetes orchestration layer for running containerized workloads.                                       |
|                            | **Platform Orchestration** | Custom controllers or Helm charts that automate deployment to EKS and manage platform-wide resources.    |
| **Monitoring**             | **Amazon CloudWatch**  | Aggregates metrics, logs, and emits alerts for platform health and performance.                          |
| **Security**               | **HashiCorp Vault**    | Centralized secrets management—stores and dynamically injects credentials, certificates, and API keys.   |

## End-to-End Workflow

1. **Code Authoring**  
   - Developers work locally in an IDE.  
   - Changes are committed to GitHub, triggering Pull Requests and peer review.

2. **Infrastructure Provisioning**  
   - Merged Terraform configurations automatically apply via a GitHub–Jenkins integration.  
   - Platform resources (clusters, networking, IAM roles) are created or updated.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Execution**  
   - Jenkins polls GitHub for changes, then:  
     1. **Build Stage:** Compiles code, runs unit tests, and builds container images.  
     2. **Test Stage:** Executes integration and smoke tests against ephemeral environments.  
     3. **Publish Stage:** Pushes images to a container registry (e.g., ECR).

4. **Application Deployment**  
   - Platform Orchestration reads new image tags or Helm chart versions and applies them to EKS.  
   - Supports rolling updates and health checks for zero-downtime releases.

5. **Observability**  
   - CloudWatch collects pod, node, and application metrics.  
   - Alerts are configured for error rates, latency breaches, and resource saturation.

6. **Secrets Injection**  
   - Vault policies enforce least-privilege access.  
   - Kubernetes pods fetch credentials at runtime via Vault CSI or sidecar injectors.

## Security & Secrets Management

- **HashiCorp Vault**  
  - Centralizes management of database credentials, TLS certificates, and third-party API keys.  
  - Implements dynamic secrets, automatic rotation, and audit logging.

- **Network Policies & IAM**  
  - Kubernetes NetworkPolicies restrict pod-to-pod communication.  
  - AWS IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA) grant pods scoped permissions.

---

## Observability & Monitoring

- **Metrics**  
  - Node and pod CPU/memory usage, request latency, deployment health.  
- **Logging**  
  - Application and platform logs forwarded to CloudWatch Logs for search and analysis.  
- **Alerting**  
  - SNS or Slack notifications for critical incidents and SLA violations.
