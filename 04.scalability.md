# Scalability Design for EKS Platform

This document explains how our platform automatically grows and shrinks to handle different amounts of traffic while keeping costs low.

## 1. App Scaling (Kubernetes)

### **Pod Auto Scaling**

**Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**
- **What it watches**: CPU usage, memory usage, and custom metrics
- **What it does**: Add more app copies when busy, remove them when quiet
- **Speed**: Takes 30-60 seconds to add pods, 5-10 minutes to remove them
- **Custom checks**: Can watch things like queue length or request count

**Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)**
- **What it does**: Gives each app container the right amount of CPU and memory
- **Why it helps**: Saves money by not wasting resources
- **How it works**: Watches your apps and suggests better settings

**Node Auto Scaling**
- **What it does**: Adds more servers when you need them, removes them when you don't
- **Where**: Spreads servers across different zones for safety
- **Cost saving**: Uses cheaper spot instances when possible

## 2. Traffic Management

### **Load Balancer**

**How Traffic Gets Distributed**
- **Auto registration**: New app pods automatically join the load balancer
- **Health checks**: Only sends traffic to healthy pods
- **Smooth removal**: Finishes current requests before removing unhealthy pods
- **Zone spreading**: Distributes traffic evenly across all zones

**Smart Traffic Routing**
- **Path routing**: Different URLs go to different services
  - `/api/users/*` → User Service
  - `/api/orders/*` → Order Service
- **Domain routing**: Different websites for different customers
  - `company-a.myapp.com` → Company A's apps
  - `company-b.myapp.com` → Company B's apps
- **Gradual updates**: Slowly move traffic from old to new version
  - Start: 90% old version, 10% new version
  - End: 0% old version, 100% new version

## 3. Database Scaling

### **Database Growth**

**Read Replicas**
- **What they do**: Create copies of your database for reading data
- **When they help**: When lots of people are reading but not writing
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically adds more read copies when needed

**Storage Growth**
- **What happens**: Database storage grows automatically when it gets full
- **Monitoring**: Tracks database performance and suggests improvements

## 4. App-Level Scaling

### **Individual Service Scaling**

**Each Service Scales Separately**
- **Custom metrics**: Each app scales based on what matters most to it
- **Protection**: Rate limiting stops any single user from overloading the system

### **Build Pipeline Scaling**

**Jenkins (Build System)**
- **Dynamic workers**: Creates build servers when needed, removes them when done
- **Right-sized machines**: Uses appropriate server size for each type of build
- **Cost optimization**: Uses cheaper servers for building code

---

## 5. Monitoring What's Happening

### **What We Watch**

**App Performance**
- **Request speed**: How fast apps respond to users
- **Error tracking**: Count of failed requests

**Infrastructure Health**
- **Server usage**: CPU, memory, and storage on all servers
- **Cluster status**: Health of the Kubernetes cluster
- **Cost tracking**: How much everything costs in real-time

**Datadog Integration**
- **Real-time monitoring**: See what's happening right now
- **Smart alerts**: AI detects unusual patterns and sends alerts
- **User experience**: Track how real users experience your app

## Best Practices

### **Scaling Strategy**
1. **Go slow**: Make gradual changes to avoid breaking things
2. **Test regularly**: Make sure scaling works under heavy load

### **Save Money**
1. **Use spot instances**: Get cheaper servers when possible
2. **Right-size everything**: Don't pay for resources you don't use
3. **Plan ahead**: Scale up before busy periods if you know they're coming

This setup keeps your apps running smoothly whether you have 10 users or 10,000 users, all in the us-east-1 region.
