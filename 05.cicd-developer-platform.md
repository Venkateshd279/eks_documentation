# CI/CD and Developer Platform for EKS

This guide shows our complete CI/CD pipeline and developer platform that supports microservices deployment with automation, security, and reliability.

## Architecture Overview

![CI/CD Flow](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1GJZSyboV7EyaL4qZlWPuaDRb1uipPwec)

Our platform provides a comprehensive CI/CD experience using GitHub for source control, Jenkins for automation, and Amazon ECR + EKS for container deployment.

## 1. Basic Pipeline Flow

### **Simple 8-Step Process**

1. **Code & Push**  
   - Developers write code locally and push to GitHub
   - A webhook notifies Jenkins of the new commit

2. **Checkout & Scan**  
   - Jenkins pulls the code
   - SonarQube scans for bugs and style issues
   - **Fail** → Pipeline stops and team fixes code
   - **Pass** → Continue

3. **Build & Artifact**  
   - Jenkins builds the app (compiles or packages)
   - The build artifact is stored and tagged (e.g., `v1.2.3`)

4. **Docker Image**  
   - Jenkins runs the Dockerfile to create a container image
   - The image is tagged and pushed to Amazon ECR

5. **Update Config**  
   - Jenkins updates deployment files (e.g., sets the new image tag)

6. **Kubernetes Check**  
   - Jenkins verifies access to the EKS cluster

7. **Deploy & Rollout**  
   - Jenkins applies Kubernetes manifests 
   - Kubernetes performs a rolling update for zero downtime

8. **Verify Deployment**  
   - Jenkins runs quick tests (smoke or health checks)
   - **Success** → Pipeline ends
   - **Failure** → Alerts sent and rollback can occur

## 2. Source Code Management

### **GitHub Integration**

**Repository Structure**
- **Application Code**: Microservices source code with standardized structure
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform configurations for all AWS resources

**Git Workflow Strategy**
- **Feature Branches**: Development work isolated in feature branches
- **Pull Request Process**: Code review and automated testing before merge

---

## 3. Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline

### **Jenkins on EKS Architecture**

**Scalable Build Infrastructure**
- **Jenkins Controller**: Runs on EKS for high availability
- **Dynamic Agents**: Kubernetes-based Jenkins agents that scale on demand

**Multi-Environment Pipeline**
- **Development**: Automatic deployment on feature branch updates
- **Production**: Manual approval gate with automated deployment

## 4. GitOps with ArgoCD

### **ArgoCD Deployment Strategy**

**Multi-Cluster Management**
- **Centralized ArgoCD**: Single ArgoCD instance managing multiple EKS clusters
- **Application Deployment**: App-of-apps pattern for hierarchical management
**GitOps Workflow**
- **Jenkins Build**: Successful CI pipeline execution and manifest update
- **ArgoCD Sync**: Automatic synchronization with target clusters and health monitoring

---

## 5. Container Registry and Security

### **Amazon ECR Integration**

**Image Management**
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated security scanning on image push
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Automated cleanup of old and unused images
