# EKS Platform Documentation

Simple guide for building and running applications on Amazon EKS with automated deployments.

## Requirements

### **Functional Requirements (What It Does)**
- **Code Deployment**: Automatically build, test, and deploy applications from GitHub
- **Container Management**: Run applications in Docker containers on Kubernetes
- **User Access Control**: Manage who can access what parts of the platform
- **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Create and manage AWS resources with Terraform
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Track application health and send notifications
- **Secret Management**: Securely store and distribute passwords and API keys

### **Non-Functional Requirements (How Well It Works)**
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with multi-zone deployment
- **Scalability**: Auto-scale from 2 to 50+ pods based on demand
- **Performance**: Deploy new code in under 5 minutes
- **Security**: Multi-factor authentication and automatic vulnerability scanning
- **Reliability**: Zero-downtime deployments with automatic rollback on failure
- **Maintainability**: Infrastructure as Code with version control and documentation

## What This Is

A cloud platform that:
- Automatically builds and deploys your code
- Runs apps in containers on Kubernetes
- Keeps everything secure and monitored
- Scales up and down automatically
