# Building a Reliable Cloud Platform on AWS

This project shows how we built a modern platform for running web applications that can handle failures and keep running smoothly.

## What We Built

Think of this as a blueprint for creating a robust system that:
- Automatically deploys code changes safely
- Runs applications across multiple data centers 
- Switches to backup systems if something breaks
- Monitors everything and alerts us when issues happen
- Keeps data safe and secure

## Why This Matters

**For Business Leaders:**
- Your website stays online even during outages
- New features get deployed faster and safer
- Costs are optimized through smart automation
- Everything meets security and compliance standards

**For Developers:**
- Push code and it automatically gets tested and deployed
- No more manual server setup or deployment headaches
- Built-in monitoring shows exactly what's happening
- Easy to scale up when you get more users

**For Operations Teams:**
- Most maintenance happens automatically
- Clear alerts when human attention is needed
- Everything is documented and repeatable
- Disaster recovery is built-in, not an afterthought

## How It Works

### 1. Code to Production Pipeline
When developers write code and save it:
1. **GitHub** stores the code safely
2. **Jenkins** automatically runs tests and builds the application
3. **Security scans** check for vulnerabilities 
4. **Container images** get created and stored securely
5. **Kubernetes** deploys the app with zero downtime
6. **Monitoring** confirms everything is working

### 2. Two-Region Safety Net
We run everything in two different AWS regions:
- **Primary region** (US-East) handles normal traffic
- **Backup region** (US-West) stays ready to take over
- If the primary region has problems, traffic automatically switches
- Data stays synchronized between both regions

### 3. Smart Scaling
The system automatically adjusts based on demand:
- More users? More servers spin up automatically
- Quiet period? Excess servers shut down to save money
- Database getting busy? Read replicas get added
- CDN caches popular content closer to users

### 4. Security Throughout
Security isn't bolted on - it's built into everything:
- Multi-factor authentication for all access
- Automatic security scanning of code and containers
- Web firewall blocks malicious traffic
- All data encrypted and access logged

## Key Technologies

**Core Platform:**
- **Amazon EKS** - Manages our containerized applications
- **Jenkins** - Automates building and deploying code
- **Terraform** - Creates and manages all infrastructure
- **GitHub** - Stores code and triggers deployments

**Data & Storage:**
- **Amazon Aurora** - Main database with automatic backups
- **DynamoDB** - Fast database for user sessions and caching
- **S3** - Stores files, backups, and static website content

**Monitoring & Security:**
- **Datadog** - Shows us what's happening across everything
- **AWS CloudWatch** - Native AWS monitoring and alerting
- **WAF & Shield** - Protects against web attacks
- **Route 53** - Smart DNS that routes traffic to healthy systems
