# Guiding Principles

## Core Platform Principles

### 1. Security by Design
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal required permissions for all entities
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Continuous Security Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and response

### 2. High Availability and Resilience
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Services distributed across availability zones
- **Multi-Region Strategy**: Critical services replicated across regions
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating with reduced functionality during failures
- **Automated Recovery**: Self-healing capabilities for common failure scenarios
- **Disaster Recovery**: RTO < 4 hours, RPO < 1 hour for critical systems

### 3. Scalability and Performance
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Scale out rather than up
- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on demand
- **Performance Optimization**: Sub-second response times for critical operations
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimal resource utilization to minimize costs
- **Elastic Architecture**: Handle traffic spikes gracefully

### 4. Developer Experience
- **Self-Service Platform**: Developers can provision resources independently
- **GitOps Workflows**: Infrastructure and applications managed through Git
- **Automated CI/CD**: Streamlined deployment pipelines
- **Standardized Tooling**: Consistent development and deployment tools
- **Fast Feedback Loops**: Quick iterations and rapid deployment capabilities

### 5. Operational Excellence
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure defined and versioned in code
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing
- **Automation**: Minimize manual operations and human error
- **Documentation**: Living documentation that evolves with the platform
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular review and optimization cycles

### 6. Cost Optimization
- **Right-sizing**: Appropriate resource allocation for workloads
- **Reserved Capacity**: Long-term cost optimization for predictable workloads
- **Spot Instances**: Use spot instances for fault-tolerant workloads
- **Resource Scheduling**: Automatic scaling down during low-usage periods
- **Cost Monitoring**: Real-time cost tracking and alerting

### 7. Compliance and Governance
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet industry-specific requirements (SOC 2, GDPR, etc.)
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit logs for all platform activities
- **Policy Enforcement**: Automated compliance checking and enforcement
- **Data Governance**: Clear data classification and handling procedures
- **Risk Management**: Continuous risk assessment and mitigation

### 8. Microservices Best Practices
- **Service Autonomy**: Services are independently deployable and manageable
- **API-First Design**: Well-defined service interfaces
- **Database per Service**: Data isolation and ownership
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevent cascade failures
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling through asynchronous communication

### 9. Cloud-Native Principles
- **Container-First**: All applications containerized
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: No in-place modifications
- **Stateless Services**: Externalize state where possible
- **Service Mesh**: Standardized service-to-service communication
- **Platform Agnostic**: Avoid vendor lock-in where possible

### 10. Environmental Responsibility
- **Green Computing**: Optimize for energy efficiency
- **Resource Optimization**: Minimize waste through efficient resource usage
- **Sustainable Practices**: Consider environmental impact in architectural decisions

## Implementation Guidelines

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
All significant architectural decisions must be documented using ADRs, including:
- Context and problem statement
- Considered options
- Decision rationale
- Consequences and trade-offs

### Review and Validation
- All architectural changes undergo peer review
- Security review for all external-facing components
- Performance testing for scalability requirements
- Cost impact analysis for new services

### Continuous Alignment
- Regular architecture review sessions
- Quarterly principle assessment and updates
- Feedback loops from development teams
- Alignment with business objectives and compliance requirements
