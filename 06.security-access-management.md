# Security & Access Management for EKS Platform

This document explains how we keep our microservices platform safe and control who can access what.

---

## 1. User Login & Access Control

### **How People Log In**

**Two-Factor Login (MFA)**
- **Phone/App Verification**: Everyone needs phone or app code to log in
- **Temporary Access Keys**: No permanent passwords - everything expires
- **Session Timeouts**: Automatic logout after being inactive

**Different User Types**
- **Developers**: Can access their apps, see basic system info
- **DevOps Engineers**: Can manage the whole platform and deploy apps
- **Security Team**: Can see everything but only for monitoring
- **Operations Team**: Can fix problems and manage day-to-day operations

### **Automatic Tool Access**

**Service Accounts (For Tools)**
- **Jenkins**: Gets permission to build and deploy apps
- **Monitoring Tools**: Can collect data and send alerts
- **Terraform**: Can create and change infrastructure

## 2. Permission Monitoring & Cleanup

**Finding Unused Permissions**
- **Too Many Rights**: Finds people who have more access than they need
- **Unused Access**: Spots permissions nobody is using
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Every 3 months, check all user permissions
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Remove permissions that haven't been used

---

## 3. Website Protection & Attack Prevention

**Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
- **Rate Limiting**: Stops too many requests from same user
- **Bad IP Blocking**: Blocks known troublemakers automatically
- **Bot Detection**: Finds and blocks bad robots

**DDoS Protection**
- **Traffic Flooding**: Protects against massive traffic attacks
- **Real-Time Detection**: Spots attacks as they happen
- **Emergency Response**: AWS experts help during major attacks

## 4. Container & Kubernetes Security

**Each App Gets Its Own Identity**
- **Individual Permissions**: Each microservice gets only what it needs
- **No Shared Passwords**: Apps don't share login credentials
- **Automatic Updates**: Security credentials refresh automatically

**Network Security**
- **App Communication Rules**: Control which apps can talk to each other
- **Container Scanning**: Check all app containers for security problems

---

## 5. Password & Secret Management

**Central Secret Storage**
- **Database Passwords**: All database passwords stored securely
- **API Keys**: Third-party service keys kept safe
- **Certificates**: Website security certificates managed automatically

**Automatic Updates**
- **Password Changes**: Database passwords change automatically
- **Certificate Renewal**: Website certificates renew before expiring
---

## 6. Monitoring & Compliance

**Security Monitoring**
- **Log Analysis**: Automatically check all system logs for issues (Datadog, Cloudwatch)
- **Instant Alerts**: Get notified immediately of security problems

**AWS Security Tools**
- **Configuration Monitoring**: Make sure everything is set up securely
- **Activity Tracking**: Log every action taken on AWS
