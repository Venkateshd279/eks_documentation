# Deploy Microservices with CI/CD on Amazon EKS

This document details the AWS services we use to build a highly available, fault-tolerant microservices platform with CI/CD.

---

## 1. CI/CD Pipeline

- **GitHub**  
  Stores source code and Terraform infrastructure configurations.

- **Jenkins**  
  Orchestrates build → test → deploy workflows. Runs on EKS for scalability.

- **Terraform**  
  Provisions VPC, EKS clusters, databases, and all infrastructure in us-east-1. 

This document lists the AWS services we will use to build a highly available, fault-tolerant platform. 
---

## 1. Identity & Access

- **AWS SSO (IAM Identity Center)**  
  Single place for everyone to log in. Works with our company  OIDC (OpenID Connect). OIDC helps to connect with Kubernetes AWS SSO. 

- **IAM**  
  - Create roles for each job (e.g. “DevOps Engineer,” “Auditor”).  


---

## 2. Kubernetes & Compute

- **Amazon EKS**  
  Managed Kubernetes spanning multiple Availability Zones per region.

- **EKS Managed Node Groups**  
  AWS-managed EC2 instances that automatically join the EKS cluster with proper configuration.

- **Auto Scaling Groups**  
  Automatically maintains sufficient worker nodes based on demand.


---

## 3. Networking & Traffic

- **VPC**  
  Network isolation with public and private subnets across multiple AZs.

- **ALB**  
  Application and Network Load Balancers for layer-7 traffic distribution.

- **Route 53**  
  DNS with health-check based failover between regions.

- **CloudFront & S3**  
  Global content delivery network for static assets and caching.

---

## 4. Data & Storage

- **RDS Multi-AZ (SQL Database)**  
  Primary SQL database with standby replica in separate AZ within each region.

- **S3**  
  Durable object storage with cross-region replication for backups and static content.

---

## 5. Monitoring & Alerts

- **Datadog**  
  Centralized application logs and metrics monitoring across both regions.

- **CloudWatch**  
  AWS infrastructure metrics, logs, and native service monitoring.

- **EventBridge → SNS**  
  Routes alarms and events to email, SMS, and other notification channels. Need to create eventbridge alerts. That will route the traffic to SNS. 

---

## 6. Security & Access

- **MFA**  
  Multi-factor authentication.

- **IAM Access Analyzer**  
  Automatically detects overly broad permissions and access patterns.

- **WAF & Shield**  
  Web Application Firewall and DDoS protection for applications and infra.
