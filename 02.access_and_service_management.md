# Access & Service Account Management

A simple guide to managing who and what can access our AWS resources.

---

## 1. Identity & Authentication

- **Single Sign-On**  
  Use AWS SSO  so everyone logs in the same way.  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
  Require MFA for all user sign-ins.  
- **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**  
  Set rules at the organization level to prevent certain actions across all AWS accounts.

---

## 2. User Roles & Permissions

- **Role-Based Access**  
  Create IAM roles for each job function (e.g. “DevOps-Engineer”, “Security-Auditor”).  
- **Least Privilege**  
  Grant only the exact permissions each role needs.  


---

## 3. Service Accounts

- **EKS IRSA**  
  Map Kubernetes ServiceAccounts to specific IAM roles.  
- **Dedicated Automation Roles**  
  Give Jenkins, Terraform, and other tools their own IAM roles.  
- **Secrets Storage**  
  Keep passwords, API keys, and certificates in Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

---

## 4. Auditing & Reviews

- **CloudTrail Everywhere**  
  Keep cloud trail logs in S3 bucket.
- **Access Analyzer**  
  Regularly scan IAM policies to catch overly broad permissions.  
- **Periodic Reviews**  
  Every quarter, clean up unused users and roles.

## 5. Onboarding & Self-Service

- **Infrastructure as Code**  
  Define all IAM roles and policies in Terraform, versioned in GitHub.  
- **Self-Service Portal**  
  Provide a simple UI or scripts to request access  
- **Automated Offboarding**  
  Tie user removal to GitHub team changes so access is revoked quickly.
